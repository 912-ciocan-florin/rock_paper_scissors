# Rock Paper Scissors - The Game

## Prologue
The "war" between the computer and man has always been a subject of major intrigue
throughout history. So, I created an application in which this "war" against
the computer will be played through the well-known game "Rock, Paper, Scissors".
Computer choices are random, so the player's decisions are decisive.
The first at 3 victories will win the game.

## How to play
1. Run the `Rock_Paper_Scissors.exe` file
2. App will run a Splash Screen (Loading Screen) until all the game components are set
3. After loading the Game interface appearance. Here are presented the title of the game, the scoreboard, and those 3 options (Rock, Paper, Scissors) which can be selected with the mouse click
4. After the score reach 3 at one of the players the result of the game is showed.
5. Two options appearance under scoreboard:
    + New game - to start a new game (the scoreboard is reset)
    + Exit - close the game
